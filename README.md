CyberPunk terminal themes made using terminal.sexy from [Murderlon/cyberpunk-iterm](https://github.com/Murderlon/cyberpunk-iterm) that was inspired from the [vscode theme](https://github.com/prometheux-ar/cyberpunk) made by [max-SS](https://github.com/max-SS).

I think i got that right but idk.. 

I really like this theme though.

You can make more themes at terminal.sexy

There is also a theme for chromium based browsers by Angus found [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cyberpunk/ekkfihjmcoeplagmladakeignpdaecmc).

Along with this I am using the TLV extension with a custom theme to match.
